# ServerSocketStressTest

There's a Company (Kitchen) that produces Products (Dishes) that consist of Materials (Ingredients).

The product range is predefined. For the production of each product, a certain set of raw materials is required. The price of the product is made up of the prices of the raw materials in the appropriate proportion. The prices of the raw materials are constant and known in advance. The client (customer) applies to the company with an order for one of the products it produces in the required quantity. If at the moment the company cannot produce the required amount of goods, the client is refused. If there is a product, then the product is delivered to the client, and the money goes to the firm's account.

The supplier contacts the firm with an offer to supply some source material. If the company has a sufficient amount, then a purchase takes place, otherwise the supplier is refused. At the very beginning of the work, the company has a certain amount in its account. At any given time, the firm must be able to provide a report on the status of its account, statistics on order processing and the quantity of materials in the warehouse.
